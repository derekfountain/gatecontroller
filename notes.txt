Wisdom from AM in Slack:

You need a maglock output and a crush sensor input
And an RF blipper receiver
You want to keep the motor drive lines away from other lines
And make them the fattest tracks you can fit

You'd not use a regulator, you'd use a voltage divider
Andrew Menadue So you'd use a voltage divider for the 24V thing (divide by 5-is)
If a 'thing' has a switch and it is just contacts and no voltage come sout then they are called 'voltage free' contacts
An input to an arduino only needs a few hundred uA to work, so the voltage divider only needs to have that passing through it.

When it comes to laying out the board and to som extent the circuit there a a few things you'll need to do.
You need to separate the high current high voltage stuff from th elow voltage stuff, and look after your grounds.
You need a motor supply that is separate from the logic supply.
You need to make sure your tracks are big enough for the 3A motor current. It's urprising how small a track that carries 3A can be.
The biggest problem you will have is noise. Noise from being out in the open and noise from the motor
Spurious resets, that sort of thing

Well, you could use a 5V supply to the switch. Just because the motor is 24V doesn't mean the switche have to be, unless they are wired to the 24V internally.

Looking after your ground means taking more care than connecting them together

As it's a 24V motor then yes. You could use a separate supply altogether for the logic. That isolates the noise nicely.

You probably want a good sprinkling of LEDs too, so you can see what's happening and maybe an OLED display too.

Just make the outline bigger, there's no problem. Or put the Uno on top, not underneath. That's probably easier to mount as well.

It's pretty simple, just if this input does this then waggle that, so I think an Uno would do. the only possibly hard work that would need doing would be the RF blipper. There's not a huge amount of flash or RAM but should be enough I'd have thought

It's not really a standard design, but th emotor thing is a sort of h bridge
00 or 11 is off
01 is fwd
10 is backwards
the input has a current limiting series resistor, clamping diodes and a capacitor to stop high frequency noise to some degree
